DEDICATION & CREDITS:
HamClock-Next wouldn't exist without the incredible foundation laid by Elwood Downey 
(WB0OEW). His original HamClock project defined the aesthetic and functional standard 
for amateur radio dashboards. This reconstruction preserves his design vision while 
modernizing the underlying technology for current platforms.

MAINTENANCE NOTE:
This version of HamClock has been reconstructed as a modern SDL2 application. 
It operates independently of the legacy backend services provided by the original 
author, connecting directly to public data sources (NOAA, NASA, Open-Meteo, etc.) 
and using local resources to ensure continued operation for the community.
